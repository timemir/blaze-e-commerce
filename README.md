## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB

It is made with React, and uses React Router for routing. It uses unique components for the UI, and Zustand for state management. It uses MongoDB for the database, and Express for the backend. It uses (...Stripe?) for payments. It uses (...React Helmet?) for SEO. 

## Optimizations

<!-- You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews! -->
Just started working on it, so there's a lot of room for optimization. ;)

<!-- ## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing. -->
